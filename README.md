## Chunky-fork

Used for benchmarking and pressure-testing C2ME

# New features
- Chunked chunk generation pattern to make better use of half-generated chunks (ProtoChunk technically) resulting in a much higher pregen speed  
  Usage: `chunky pattern chunked_<pattern>`  
  [Available values for \<pattern\>](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki/Patterns)  
  Note that the default pattern is still `concentric`

## Chunky

Pre-generates chunks, quickly, efficiently, and safely
